## Beanstalkg

Beanstalkg is a golang implementation of [beanstalkd](https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd). Idea is to support the same set of features and protocol with the addition of
high availability and failover built in. You can read the plan.md if interested in contributing.

Still getting off the ground at the time of writing :)
